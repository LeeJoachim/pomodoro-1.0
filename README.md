# pomodoro-1.0

### About

This is an implementation of a pomodoro application inspired by the Java ChronoUnit API. This application overcomes the classical time problems of Java with the ChronoUnit API. This is a simple app that has code that does seem a little bit sequential and duplicative. But I had worked to divide dependency and make encapsulation. This has a Timer and Thread API. That is why I was more careful than before.
